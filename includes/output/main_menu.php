<h2>Welcome!</h2>
<p>This is a web app designed for William Fayers, by Alex Fayers, so that he can revise!
You can add terms and their definitions, and practice learning them! It's not pretty, but it works!
</p>
<p>Hopefully it's useful. If it's not, I made it anyway so that's cool :D</p>
<br>
<p>(-_-) I better get my energy drinks and Buenos as payment (-_-)</p>
<p>- Love from Alex</p>
